## 🛡️ Security Best Practices  
To maintain a secure environment, we follow industry standards:  

- **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive credentials (API keys, database URIs) securely.  
- **OWASP Guidelines**: Follow best practices for authentication, authorization, and data security.  
- **Dependency Updates**: Regularly audit and update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.  
- **Rate Limiting & Validation**: Prevent abuse with proper input validation and request throttling.  
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Detect anomalies using structured logging and monitoring tools.  

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure  
We appreciate ethical security researchers who follow **responsible disclosure** guidelines.  

- Do **not** exploit vulnerabilities beyond what’s necessary for proof-of-concept.
