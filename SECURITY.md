# Security Policy

## Overview

Security is a top priority for the Amar Contacts project. This document outlines the security measures implemented and the process for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

This project is a personal portfolio demonstration. Security updates are applied to the latest version only.

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| Latest   | :white_check_mark: |
| < Latest | :x:                |

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Token Security**: Secure access and refresh token implementation
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds for secure password storage
- **Token Expiration**: Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) with refresh token rotation
- **OTP Verification**: Email-based one-time password verification
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks

### Data Protection

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM prevents injection attacks
- **XSS Protection**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables

### API Security

- **Authentication Middleware**: Protected routes require valid JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access**: User authorization based on roles and permissions
- **Request Sanitization**: Malicious input filtering
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without sensitive information leakage

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS Ready**: Application configured for secure HTTPS deployment
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of security headers (Helmet.js ready)
- **Session Security**: Redis-based session management with secure configurations
- **Docker Security**: Containerized deployment with security best practices

## Security Best Practices Followed

### Code Security

- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data managed through environment variables
- **Dependency Management**: Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- **TypeScript**: Type safety to prevent runtime errors and security issues
- **Linting**: ESLint configuration with security rules
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests including security test cases

### Database Security

- **Connection Security**: Secure MongoDB connection strings
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encryption at rest
- **Query Security**: Parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks
- **Access Controls**: Database user with minimal required permissions

### Monitoring & Logging

- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error logging without sensitive data exposure
- **Access Logging**: Request logging for security monitoring
- **Audit Trail**: User action tracking for security auditing

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Important**: This is a personal portfolio project for demonstration purposes only. It is not intended for production use with real user data.

If you discover a security vulnerability in this codebase that could be educational or help improve the implementation, please follow these steps:

### Preferred Method

1. **Email**: Send details to [your-email@example.com]
2. **Subject Line**: `[SECURITY] Amar Contacts - [Brief Description]`
3. **Include**:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Include

- **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
- **Location**: File paths and line numbers where applicable
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Impact**: Potential security implications
- **Environment**: Version, OS, browser (if applicable)

### What NOT to Include

- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability before it's addressed
- Do not attempt to access, modify, or delete data
- Do not perform extensive testing that might impact system performance

## Response Timeline

Since this is a personal project:

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Implementation**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Disclosure**: After fix is implemented and tested

## Security Considerations for Educational Use

This project demonstrates security best practices but should not be used in production without additional security measures:

### Additional Production Requirements

- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**
- **DDoS Protection**
- **Advanced Monitoring and Alerting**
- **Security Auditing and Penetration Testing**
- **Compliance Requirements** (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**
- **Advanced Encryption** for sensitive data fields

### Learning Opportunities

This codebase demonstrates:

- Secure authentication patterns
- Input validation techniques
- Error handling best practices
- Security middleware implementation
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure API design principles

## Disclaimer

This project is created for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes. While security best practices are implemented, this code should not be deployed in production environments without thorough security review and additional hardening measures.

The author is not responsible for any security issues that may arise from the use of this code in production environments.
